JadeVu
======

Jadevu allows to expose pre-compile Jade templates to the client side through an
extremely simple and easy-to-use API.

## Example

In your jade template, use the `template:` filter and set the `id` property:

    p Hello world

    template(id="my-template"):
      div
        p This is my template
        - if (a == 2)
          p It can have code
        - else
          p It can have many things

When compiled, this turns into HTML that looks like this:

```html
<p>Hello world</p>

<script>
  if ('undefined' == typeof template) template = function (id, params) { â€¦ }
  template._['my-template'] = function () { /* precompiled template */ };
</script>
```

What does this mean? From your client-side (eg: jQuery) code, you can include that
mini-template, and turn it into HTML:

```html
<script>
  // hint: if jQuery is loaded, `template` will return a jQuery object
  template('my-template', { a: 2 }).appendTo('body');
</script>
```

## How to use

Simply add `require('jadevu')` to your app.

## How it compares to alternatives

### Running jade in the browser

JavaScript code is run in a single thread of execution in the browser. The
unnecessary overhead of running a lexer and parser in the client translates
into less time for the browser to do other things. Large templates can result
in perceived periods of blocking-ness with heavy interaction in large web
applications.

In addition, including jade among your browser scripts adds unnecessary weight
to your pages.

### Ajax

Some projects want to do everything (including compilation) in the server-side.
This of course comes with a huge latency penalty for templates that appear
multiple times in the same page or are rendered as the result of real-time push
(such as [http://socket.io](socket.io))

### Building HTML manually with jQuery

Cumbersome concatenation, hard to include logic (like the `if` statement in the
example above).
